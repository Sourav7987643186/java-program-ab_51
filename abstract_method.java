	 * Abstract method  :>>>>>----
	 Abstract method are those methods which does not have any implementation in it.
	 ex: void and ending with the semicolon(;).
	 void add();
	 *any method which is abstract we have to write abstract infrornt of it.
	 *syntax: abstract void add();
	 * Abstract method should always be overridden.
	 * only non static methods always can be abstract methods.
	 * it only be present in abstract classes.
	 * Abstract method can also consist of concrete method.
	 * Abstract method should not present in child class.    **
	 * 
	 * 
	 *Abstract classes :-->>
	 *Abstract classes are those class which can have abstract method in it.
	 *Abstract classes also can consist of concrete method because with help of abstract class we can achieve 0 to 100%.
	 *we can hiding 0 to 100% data, during merging with other companies.
	 *we can not hide concrete method data during merging.

	 * Concrete method :>>--
	 * those method that has the implementation.
	 * implementation means method body.
	 * it can be static or non static
	 * 
	 * By the help of interface we can achieve 100% abstraction.   **
	 * There is no process of creating concrete method in interface.

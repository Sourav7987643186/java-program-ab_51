 super calling statement super() :>>>>>>>>-----

. It is used to call the parent class contractor from the child class constructor
. Super() statement should always be the first line in every constructor  **
. super calling statement can be written implicitly and explicitly (can be written directly or indirectly)
. explicitly > no need to write, its already present      > don't write it
. implicitly > go and write 
. In a single constructor, here should be just one super() statement only because super() statement can not be present in second line. if not it will give compile time error.
. In a single constructor there should be one Super() only.
. Super() statement can not be present in second line
. It is two types because constructor are also two types

. Types :>>
. 1.parameterized super calling statement            {parameterized super()}      
. 2. Non-parameterized super calling statement       {non-parameterized super()}

1.parameterized super calling statement : 
. It is called parameterized constructor.
. only can be written explicitly.

2. Non parameterized super calling statement	 
. It is called non parameterized constructor.
. It can be written both implicitly and eplicitely.

{/*
	             Interface
	 * can provide 100% abstraction as it can hold just abstract methods.
	 * Syntax: 
	 * interface Amazon
	 * {
	 * ....
	 * }
	 * Abstract method in the interface need not be written be as abstract.
	 * ex: 
	 * interface Amazon
	 * {
	 * void add();
	 * }
	 * by default all the methods of interface are public.
	 * whenever have to create relationship between 
	 * class and interface, by using   >>-- "implements" keyword.
	 * abstract class to Interface     >>-- implements keyword.
	 * interface to interface          >>--  extends keyword
	 * interface to class              >>-- not possible
	 * 
	 *           Difference between interface and abstract classes :>>>>--
	 * 1. 
	 * Interface: we can achieve 100% abstraction
	 * Abstract class: 0 to 100% abstraction
	 * 
	 * 2.
	 * Interface: we can achieve multiple level interface.
	 * Abstract class: 0 to 100% abstraction
	 * 
	 * 3. 
	 * Interface: only abstract method have.
	 * Abstract class: both abstract method as well as concrete method having.
	 * 
	 * 4.
	 * Interface: it can create the relationship with the class using "implements" keyword.
	 * Abstract class: it can create the relationship with the class using "extends" keyword.
	 * 
	 * 5.
	 * Interface: All the method in the interface are by default public
	 * Abstract class: It can take any access specifier explicitly.
	 * 
	 * 6. 
	 * Interface: all the variable are by default are public, static, and final.
	 * Abstract class: here by default are not.
	 * 
	 * 7.
	 * Interface: it can inherit another interface only.
	 * Abstract class: it can inherits a abstract class and also a interface. 
	 * 
	 *        What is abstraction ??
	 * Hiding the implementation of the class and exposing only what is required, is called as abstraction.
	 * this can be achieve in two ways :
	 * 1. Abstract class: 0 to 100% abstraction
	 * 2. Interface: 100% abstraction
	 * 
	 *    difference between  abstract and abstraction
	 *abstract             abstraction
	 *
	 * 
	 * Access specifier
	 * types: 4
	 * 1. public
	 * 2. private
	 * 3. package/ default
	 * 4. protected
	 * 
	 * 
	 * it can be present for
	 * classes, interface, abstract methods, variables
	 * 
	 * how the role of the access specifier with all methods ??
	 *

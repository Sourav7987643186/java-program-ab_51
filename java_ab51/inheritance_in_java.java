		 *:>>>>> Inheritance :>>>>--
		Inheriting is the property from one class to another class is called as Inheritance.
		Property means variable and methods.
		Here method means only static and non static not constructor.
		Contractor can not be inheritance in java.        why ?
		Real purpose of Inheritance is code re-usability.
		Main method always should be present in sub class or child class
		public static void main(String[] args)
		
		Types: 
		1. Single level inheritance
		2. Multi level Inheritance
		3. Multiple Level Inheritance
		4. Hyrirachail level inheritance
		5. Hybrid Level Inheritance
		
		1. Single level inheritance :>>>>----
		. In single level inheritance one sub class inherits the property of only one single parent class.
		. ex:- Class one extends two.
		
		2. Multi level Inheritance :>>>>>----
		. In Multi level inheritance one sub class is again inherits the property from one super class.
		. ex:- 
		
		3. Multiple Level Inheritance :>>>----
		. In the case of Multiple level inheritance single sub class will be inheritant more than or more than two super classes.
		. This inheritance is not possible to achive in java using the concept of "class", but it is definitely possible to achive using the concept of "interface"
		. Because this gives us a "Diamond problem".
		. Diamond problem : The diamond problem is a situation in object-oriented programming where a class inherits from two or more parent classes that have the same method or field
		. The diamond problem is also known as the "Deadly Diamond of Death". 
		. 
		. ex: 
		
		4. Hyrirachail level inheritance :>>>>----
		. In Hyrirachail level inheritance the single super class will be inherited by many child(sub class, it can be two or more than two) classes.
		. ex: 
		
		5. Hybrid Level Inheritance :>>>>>-----
		. The combination of single level, multi level, and Hyrirachail level inheritance, is called Hybrid level inheritance.
		. ex.

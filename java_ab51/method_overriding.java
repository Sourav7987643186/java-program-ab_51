	 * Developing a method in the child class with the same name and signature as in the parent class but with different implementation, is called as method over riding.
	 * Signature of a method means: the return type of the method including parameters of the method.
	 * 
	 * Declaration   -----int a 
	 * initialization  ---- a=100
	 * utilization   -----sop(a)
	 * implementation   ---- method body
	 * 
	 * Rules to achieve Method_overriding
	 * 1. there should be relationship between class.
	 * 2. we can only override the non static methods.
	 * 3. both the methods should be of same name.
	 * 
	 *

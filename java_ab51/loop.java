	 * 
	 * for loop: 
	 * syntax
	 * for(declearization and initialization;condition;increment/decrement operator)
	 * 
	 * for(int i=1;i<3;i++)

	 * java.util package   >>>>>>>: any class that comes from java.util package >> need to import        **
	 * 
	 * 3 types: >>
	 * 1. For loop-->> Used when you know the exact number of iterations needed in advance.
	 * 2. while loop-->> Used when you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand, and the loop continues as long as a condition remains true.
	 * 3. do while loop-->>: Similar to a while loop, but guarantees that the loop body executes at least once before checking the condition.

	 *Math class :>>--

	 *it is found in java 1.0
	 *Pre-defined class
	 *it has only static methods, to do any arithmetic (Mathamatic) problems , etc.
